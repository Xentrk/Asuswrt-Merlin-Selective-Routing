## Introduction
**x3mRouting** includes selective routing features for LAN Clients, OpenVPN Clients and OpenVPN Servers.

If coming from the first generation of x3mRouting, please read the updated instructions in the README.md to become familiar with the new features and usage instructions. Refer to the [Version 2.0.0 Changes](https://github.com/Xentrk/x3mRouting/tree/x3mRouting-NG#version-200-changes) section for a complete description of the changes and the update process.

#### 1. LAN Client Routing

An alternative approach to automate and easily assign LAN clients to a WAN or VPN Client interface. This option eliminates the need to enter the LAN Client information and IP addresses in the OpenVPN Client Screen. The **LAN Clients** option can be used by itself or with one of the two options below.

#### 2. OpenVPN Client Screen, OpenVPN Event & x3mRouting.sh Script

Provides the ability to create IPSET lists using the **x3mRouting.sh** script and selectively route the IPSET lists thru the VPN Client by entering the IPSET name in a modified OpenVPN Client Screen. The customized OpenVPN Client Screen is still a work in progress. You can't use the screen to route IPSET lists to bypass the VPN Client and route to the WAN interface at this time. Use option 3 instead.

#### 3. OpenVPN Event & x3mRouting.sh Script

The **x3mRouing.sh** script provides the ability to

  * Create IPSET lists with no routing rules. The feature is for those who prefer to use the custom OpenVPN Client Screen.
  * Create and selectively route IPSET lists to the VPN Client interface or bypass a VPN Client interface for all traffic or specific devices.
  * Route VPN Server traffic to one of the VPN Clients.
  * Selectively route VPN Server traffic to an existing IPSET list routing rule.

#### 4. getdomainnames.sh Script
This script will create a uniquely sorted list of domain names from dnsmasq.log that you collected by accessing a website or streaming service. Use the script when analyzing domains used by a website or streaming service.

## Support
For help and support, please visit the Asuswrt-Merlin x3mRouting support thread on [snbforums.com](https://www.snbforums.com/threads/x3mrouting-selective-routing-for-asuswrt-merlin-firmware.57793/#post-506675).

## Requirements
1. An Asus router with [Asuswrt-Merlin](http://asuswrt.lostrealm.ca/) firmware installed.
2. A USB drive with [entware](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin/wiki/Entware) installed. Entware can be installed using [amtm - the SNBForum Asuswrt-Merlin Terminal Menu](https://www.snbforums.com/threads/amtm-the-snbforum-asuswrt-merlin-terminal-menu.42415/)
3. Policy Rules (Strict) or Policy Rules enabled on the OpenVPN Client Screen.

## Project Development
I used Amazon Prime, BBC, CBS All Access, Hulu, Netflix and Sling streaming media services in developing the project and include them in the usage examples below.

Please beware that Amazon Prime, BBC, Hulu and Netflix block known VPN servers. If you want a VPN provider who can circumvent the VPN blocks, see my blog post [Why I use Torguard as my VPN Provider](https://x3mtek.com/why-i-use-torguard-as-my-vpn-provider) to learn more.

## Installation

Copy and paste the command below into an SSH session:

    sh -c "$(curl -sL https://x3mtek.com/install_x3mRouting)"

This command will download and install the installation menu **x3mRouting** to the **/opt/bin** directory. The installation script is a menu with options to install the three options described below, and options to update or remove the repository. To access the installation menu, type the command **x3mRouting**. Option **[7]  Update x3mRouting Menu** will only appear when a new installation menu is detected on the GitHub repository. Option **[u]  Update to new version of x3mRouting** will only appear if you have the prior version of x3mRouting installed.

## x3mRouting Options

### [1] LAN Client Routing
In the Asuswrt-Merlin firmware, one must type the IP address of each LAN client into the Policy Routing section of the OpenVPN Client Screen in order to assign the LAN client to the VPN Client interface. If you have many LAN clients, the process of entering the IP address and other required information can be time consuming - especially after performing a factory reset.

The x3mRouting LAN Client method is an alternative approach to assigning LAN clients to a WAN or VPN Client interface. If you have many LAN clients to assign to the interface, the scripts will eliminate the manual effort involved in typing the DHCP IP address of each LAN client in the Policy Routing section of the OpenVPN Client Screen. You can still use the OpenVPN Client Screen to assign LAN clients in addition to using this feature. The two methods can coexist.

#### x3mRouting_client_config.sh
**x3mRouting_client_config.sh** is the first script to run. The script will create the file **/jffs/scripts/x3mRouting/x3mRouting_client_rules** which contains a separate line for each LAN client with a static DHCP IP address assignment. Each line contains three fields separated by a space. The first field is a number representing the interface assignment (0=WAN, 1=OVPNC1 to 5=OVPNC5) followed by the LAN client IP address and LAN client description.

By default, the script assigns each LAN client to the OVPNC1 interface. After running the script, edit the **/jffs/scripts/x3mRouting/x3mRouting_client_rules** file and assign the interface to each LAN client. Instructions on how to assign the interface to each LAN client are located at the top of the file.

    #########################################################
    # Assign the interface for each LAN client by entering  #
    # the appropriate interface number in the first column  #
    # 0 = WAN                                               #
    # 1 = OVPNC1                                            #

    # 5 = OVPNC5                                            #
    #########################################################
    0 192.168.1.150 SamsungTV
    1 192.168.1.151 Samsung-Phone
    2 192.168.1.152 Asus-Laptop
    2 192.168.1.153 iPad
    1 192.168.1.154 Lenovo-Laptop

If an existing **/jffs/scripts/x3mRouting/x3mRouting_client_rules** file exists, a backup copy of the existing **x3mRouting_client_rules** file is made by appending the timestamp to the existing file. You only need to run this script if you have made changes to DHCP static assignments or accidentally deleted the **/jffs/scripts/x3mRouting/x3mRouting_client_rules** file.

#### x3mRouting_client_nvram.sh
**x3mRouting_client_nvram.sh** is the second script to run. This script will create the nvram files for VPN Clients in the **/jffs/addons/x3mRouting** directory based on the interface assignments in **/jffs/scripts/x3mRouting/x3mRouting_client_rules**. An nvram file will not be created in the **/jffs/addons/x3mRouting/** directory for LAN clients assigned to use the WAN interface.

Similar to the firmware, the next step is to bounce the VPN Client interface to have the routing assignments take effect. This is accomplished by selecting the **“Apply”** button on the OpenVPN Client Screen you assigned the LAN client to. Alternatively, you can bounce the WAN interface by selecting the **“Apply”** button on the WAN screen. Restarting the WAN will also restart any active VPN clients. There is a slight delay before the VPN Client becomes active. Check the status of each VPN Client using the OpenVPN Status Screen.

The routing rules for LAN Clients will automatically be applied upon a system boot. You only need to rerun **x3mRouting_client_nvram.sh** and bounce the VPN Client if you have made LAN Client interface assignment changes in the **/jffs/scripts/x3mRouting/x3mRouting_client_rules** file.

### [2] OpenVPN Client Screen, OpenVPN Event & x3mRouting.sh Script
As part of this project, you can also choose to download and install a modified OpenVPN Client Screen to selectively route IPSET lists thru a VPN Client. You can't use the screen to route IPSET lists to the WAN interface. You must use option 3 instead. See the [OpenVPN Event & x3mRouting.sh Script](https://github.com/Xentrk/x3mRouting/blob/x3mRouting-NG#3--OpenVPN-Event-&-x3mRoutingsh-Script) section below for instructions on how to create IPSET list with no routing rules for use by the OpenVPN Client Screen.

[@Martineau](https://www.snbforums.com/members/martineau.13215/) coded the revisions to the OpenVPN Client Screen as a proof of concept on how the Policy Rules section could be modified to incorporate the selective routing of IPSET lists. I greatly appreciate his generosity in providing the modified code and allowing me to include it in the project.

#### OpenVPN Client Screen ~ Policy Routing Section
![Policy Routing Screen](https://github.com/Xentrk/x3mRouting/blob/x3mRouting-NG/Policy_Routing_Screen.PNG "Policy Routing Screen")

#### IPSET Dimensions
The OpenVPN Client Screen accepts single and multiple dimension IPSET lists. See the [IPSET Man Page](http://ipset.netfilter.org/ipset.man.html) for information.

![IPSET Dimensions](https://github.com/Xentrk/x3mRouting/blob/x3mRouting-NG/OpenVPN_Client_GUI.png "OpenVPN Client Screen")

#### Video Tutorial

A video tutorial on how to allow the use of IPSET lists via the Selective routing VPN Client Policy Routing Screen can be viewed on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/287067217).

#### DummyVPN
In the screen picture above, you will notice an entry for **DummyVPN1**. For the Selective routing of Ports/MACs and IPSETs, [@Martineau](https://www.snbforums.com/members/martineau.13215/) recommends creating a “dummy” VPN Client entry if you require the ability to exploit the **Accept DNS Configuration=Exclusive** option that only creates the appropriate DNSVPN iptables chain if the routing table isn't empty in the OpenVPN Client Screen. Use a valid IPv4 address for the DummyVPN entry that differs from your LAN IPv4 address range. I recommend using a [bogon IP address](https://ipinfo.io/bogon) for this purpose.   

### [3] OpenVPN Event & x3mRouting.sh Script

#### nat-start script
When you execute **x3mRouting.sh** from the command line, **x3mRouting.sh** will add the entry to **/jffs/scripts/nat-start**. **nat-start** will run at system boot and create the IPSET list and routing rules, or after a firewall restart event to restore the routing rules.

##### /jffs/scripts/nat-start example

````

#### openvpn-event Script

x3mRouting uses the **openvpn-event** script during an VPN Client up event to restore the routing rule and during a VPN Client down event to remove the routing rule. **openvpn-event** is automatically installed when selecting options 2 and 3. When you execute **x3mRouting.sh** from the command line, **x3mRouting.sh** will add the routing rule entries to the appropriate **vpnclientX-route-up** and **vpnclientX-route-pre-down** files, where the X is the VPN Client instance.

**openvpn-event** will call VPN related scripts such as:

  * vpnclient1-route-up
  * vpnclient1-route-pre-down

located in **/jffs/scripts/x3mRouting** based on VPN Client or Server up/down events.

#### IPSET Save/Restore File Location
By default, the **/opt/tmp** entware directory is used as the IPSET save/restore file location. If you prefer, you can specify another directory location by passing a directory parameter to the script (e.g. dir=/tmp/mnt/ASUS/mylists).

#### Valid Amazon AWS Regions
**x3mRouting.sh** script will create an IPSET list containing all IPv4 address for the Amazon AWS region(s) specified. The source file used by the script is provided by Amazon at [https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json). You must specify one or more of the regions below when creating the IPSET list:

* AP - Asia Pacific
* CA - Canada
* CN - China
* EU - European Union
* SA - South America
* US - USA
* GV - USA Government
* GLOBAL - Global

#### x3mRouting.sh Usage Notes

* Required parameters are listed inside the braces { }
* Optional parameters are listed inside of the brackets [ ]
* Valid parameter values are listed in parenthesis ( )

##### Create IPSET List with no Routing Rules

````

#### dnsmasq Method with autoscan
Search dnsmasq.log file for domains that contain the keyword "amazon" and create the IPSET list AMAZON from the domains collected using the dnsmasq method. You can view the domains collected by looking at the corresponding entry in **/jffs/configs/dnsmasq.conf.add** or by looking at the script entry in **/jffs/scripts/nat-start**

````
sh /jffs/scripts/x3mRouting/x3mRouting.sh ALL 1 AMAZON autoscan=amazon
````

Search dnsmasq.log file for domains that contain the keywords "amazonaws", "netflix" and "nflx" and create the IPSET list AMZ_NFLX using the dnsmasq method.

    sh /jffs/scripts/x3mRouting/x3mRouting.sh ALL 1 AMZ_NFLX autoscan=amazonaws,netflix,nflx

#### Manual Method
The manual method is used to create IPSET lists from files in **/opt/tmp** containing the IPv4 addresses and/or IPv4 CIDR format.

Route all traffic matching IPSET list WIMIPCOM to VPN Client 1.

    sh /jffs/scripts/x3mRouting/x3mRouting.sh ALL 1 WIMIPCOM

Route all traffic matching IPSET list WIMIPCOM to VPN Client 1 using the /mnt/ASUS/mylists directory as the save/restore location.

### VPN Client Bypass Routing
Use this approach to bypass the VPN Client for traffic matching an IPSET list and route to the WAN interface. This approach is often used when a rule to route the entire LAN (e.g. 192.168.1.0/24) thru a VPN Client exists in the Policy Routing section of the OpenVPN Client Screen and an exception needs to be made to bypass the VPN Client for a service that blocks known VPN Servers.

#### ASN Method
Route VPN Client 1 traffic matching IPSET list NETFLIX to WAN.

````
sh /jffs/scripts/x3mRouting/x3mRouting.sh 1 0 NETFLIX asnum=AS2906
````

Route VPN Client 1 traffic from 192.168.1.152 matching IPSET list NETFLIX to WAN.

### [4] getdomainnames.sh Script
This script will create a uniquely sorted list of domain names from dnsmasq.log that you collected by accessing a website or streaming service. Use the script when analyzing domains used by a website or streaming service.  The script requires that the dnsmasq.log file exists in the **/opt/var/log** directory. You must first enable dnsmasq logging if it's not enabled.

#### Enable dnsmasq Logging
1. Navigate to the **/jffs/configs** directory **cd /jffs/config**
2. Use your SFTP or SSH client to create the **dnsmasq.conf.log** file
3. Add the following entry to dnsmasq.conf.log:
    log-facility=/opt/var/log/dnsmasq.log
4. Save and exit **dnsmasq.conf.log**
5. Restart dnsmasq
    service restart_dnsmasq.log

#### getdomainnames.sh Usage Instructions
1. Download the script **getdomainnames.sh**
2. Navigate to the log file directory **/opt/var/log**
3. Enter the command: **tail -f dnsmasq.log > myfile** where 'myfile' is any file name you choose.
4. Access the streaming service and watch some videos for a few seconds and select each option to generate domain names
5. Type 'Ctrl-c' to exit
6. **sh getdomainnames.sh {file} {IP}**, where 'file'
is the name of the source file you created in the **/opt/var/log** directory and 'IP' is the IPv4 address of client device that was used to collect the domains.

Usage Example:

    sh /jffs/scripts/x3mRouting/getdomainnames.sh myfile 192.168.1.50

The domains collected will be stored in the **/opt/var/log/** directory using the same name as the output file with '_domains' concatenated at the end of the file name (e.g. myfile_domains)

The next step is to check the file for domains not related to the streaming service. These are domains generated by other applications on the LAN client you streamed from that may not be related to the streaming service. You don't have to use the fully qualified domain name. For example, the domain **occ-0-1077-1062.1.nflxso.net** would be entered as **nflxso.net**. Likewise, www.netflix.com would be entered as **netflix.com**.

## Helpful Tips, Validation and Troubleshooting

### Alternative Methods Used to Identify Domain Names
#### View Source Code
Open up a desktop browser session and go to the home page for the streaming service. Right click on the page and select the option to view the page source code. In Firefox, the option is **View Page Source**. Search for the words **".com"** and **".net"**.

#### Follow the Log File
Use the **"Follow the log file"** option of [Diversion](https://diversion.ch) ad blocker to filter the log file view by LAN Client to see what domain names are being looked up.

#### How to determine AS Numbers for streaming services
Use the site [https://bgp.he.net](https://bgp.he.net/) to find AS Numbers for streaming services. You can type the name of the streaming service in the **search box** or an IP address.

Alternatively, you can use the **nslookup** command to find the IP address of a domain name. Then use the **whob** command to find the AS Number of the IP address.

    # nslookup occ-0-1077-1062.1.nflxso.net

    Server:    127.0.0.1
    Address 1: 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain

    Name:      occ-0-1077-1062.1.nflxso.net
    Address 1: 2a00:86c0:600:96::138 ipv6_1.lagg0.c009.lax004.ix.nflxvideo.net
    Address 3: 198.38.96.132 ipv4_1.lagg0.c003.lax004.ix.nflxvideo.net

    # whob 198.38.96.132 | grep AS

    Origin-AS: 2906
    AS-Path: 34224 3356 2906
    AS-Org-Name: Netflix Streaming Services Inc.

### Validation and Troubleshooting
#### IPSET lists
The install script will add a function to **/jffs/configs/profile.add** called **liststats** that will list the name of all IPSET lists and the number of IP address entries. To use the function, type **liststats** from the SSH command line (Note: For first time users, you must open up a new SSH session after running the installation script). Following is the sample output:

    AMAZON - 326
    BBC - 128
    CBS - 57
    CBS_WEB - 82
    HULU_WEB - 8
    MOVETV - 95
    NETFLIX - 150

Display information about an IPSET list, type the command **ipset -L ipset_name**. For example, to display the information about the IPSET list NETFLIX, type: **ipset -L NETFLIX**

    Name: NETFLIX
    Type: hash:net
    Revision: 6
    Header: family inet hashsize 1024 maxelem 65536
    Size in memory: 8044
    References: 1
    Number of entries: 150
    Members:

    45.57.32.0/24
    45.57.7.0/24
    45.57.65.0/24
    198.45.56.0/24
    <snip>

#### IPSET List not Populating
##### Duplicate Host Entires
Beware of duplicate hosts entries when using the DNSMASQ script method to populate an IPSET list. In the example below, the nslookup commmand will only populate the first IPSET list in **/jffs/configs/dnsmasq.conf.add**.
````
ipset=/pandora.com/PANDORA
ipset=/pandora.com/US_VPN
````
##### Local Caching DNS
There was an update made to the firmware in 384.12 that appears to prevent IPSET lists from being populated when doing an **nslookup** on a domain name.

The router will now use ISP-provided resolvers instead of local dnsmasq when attempting to resolve addresses, for improved reliability. This reproduces how stock firmware behaves. This only affects name resolution done by the router itself, not by the LAN clients. The behavior can still be changed on the **Tools** -> **Other Settings page** -> **Wan: Use local caching DNS server as system resolver (default: No)**.

#### VPN and LAN Client RPDB Routing and Priorities Rules
Type the command

    ip rule

to display the RPDB routing priority database rules for the VPN Server, VPN Server and LAN Clients:

    0:      from all lookup local
    9990:   from all fwmark 0x8000/0x8000 lookup main
    9991:   from all fwmark 0x3000/0x3000 lookup ovpnc5
    9992:   from all fwmark 0x7000/0x7000 lookup ovpnc4
    9993:   from all fwmark 0x4000/0x4000 lookup ovpnc3
    9994:   from all fwmark 0x2000/0x2000 lookup ovpnc2
    9995:   from all fwmark 0x1000/0x1000 lookup ovpnc1
    10104:  from 192.168.1.150 lookup ovpnc1

    32766:  from all lookup main
    32767:  from all lookup default

#### IPTABLES Chains

Enter the following command to display the IPTABLES Chains for the PREROUTING table:

    iptables -nvL PREROUTING -t mangle --line

The output will also display the number of packets and bytes traversing the iptables rule which can be used as confirmation that traffic is being routed according to the rule:

    Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT 5808K packets, 6404M bytes)
    num   pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination

## Acknowledgements
I want to acknowledge the following [snbforums](https://www.snbforums.com) members who helped make this project possible.
* [Martineau](https://www.snbforums.com/members/martineau.13215/) has, and continues to be, very generous in sharing his VPN and Selective Routing expertise with me over the past several years. This project was only made possible through his support and collaboration. Through his guidance, I was able to navigate through the maze of of the firmware's **vpnrouting.sh** script and enhance it to create a much cleaner implementation of my selective routing requirements when compared to the method I had been using previously.

As part of the ongoing collaboration, Martineau had modified a selective routing script I wrote for routing Netflix traffic and enhanced it by enabling the passing of parameters. The enhancements made the script more user friendly by eliminating the need for users to edit scripts to meet their use case requirements. The enhancements have been applied to all of the IPSET scripts.

Martineau also contributed the modified **OpenVPN Client Screen**, the [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/287067217) video and **Chk_Entware** function used in the project.

* [Adamm](https://github.com/Adamm00) contributed the code for restoring the IPSET lists using the **awk** method and the **md5sum** check function to detect updated code on GitHub were also inspired by Adamm.

* For the installation script, [Jack Yaz](https://github.com/jackyaz/spdMerlin) gave me permission to clone the code he used for the update code function (also inspired by Adamm) used on the [SpdMerlin](https://github.com/jackyaz/spdMerlin) project on GitHub.

* Gratitude to the [thelonelycoder](https://www.snbforums.com/members/thelonelycoder.25480/), also known as the [Decoderman](https://github.com/decoderman) on GitHub, for his inspiration and ongoing support in my coding journey.

* Thank you to [RMerlin](https://www.snbforums.com/members/rmerlin.10954/) for the [Asuswrt-Merlin](https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin.ng) firmware and helpful support on the [snbforums.com](https://www.snbforums.com/forums/asuswrt-merlin.42/) website.

## Version 2.0.0 Changes

#### VPN Server and VPN Client Routing Script Changes
  * The separate scripts for:

    * IPSET list creation and routing using the ASN, Amazon AWS, dnsmasq and manual methods
    * VPN Server to VPN Client routing (route_all_vpnserver.sh)
    * VPN Server to IPSET routing (route_ipset_vpnserver.sh)

    have been removed and the features combined into one script called **x3mRouting.sh**.
  * The method used to create the IPSET list is passed to **x3mRouting.sh** as a parameter. If the ASN, Amazon AWS or dnsmasq parameter is not specified, **x3mRouting.sh** will default to the manual method.
  * Running **x3mRouting.sh** will automatically perform the set-up.
    * **/jffs/scripts/nat-start** is used to execute the scripts at system boot or during a firewall restart event to recreate the rules deleted when the firewall was restarted.
    * The features of **openvpn-event** are used to create the routing rule during a VPN Client up event and remove the routing rule during a VPN Client down event.
  * Simplified the ability to delete an IPSET list and associated routing rules, nat-start and openvpn-event files, and cru jobs for VPN Client IPSET routing rules by passing the 'ipset_name=' and 'del' parameters to x3mRouting.sh. Deleting VPN Server to VPN Client and VPN Server to IPSET list routing rules still require that all parameters used to create the routing rules be specified in addition to the 'del' parameter.
  * **VPN Server to VPN Client** routing feature of **x3mRouting.sh**
    * The **x3mRouting.sh** script will create the required VPN Server nvram entry, eliminating the need to manually enter the VPN Server IP address in the OpenVPN Client Screen. The VPN Client will be restarted for the update to take effect. Once the restart has completed, you can view the entry in the OpenVPN Client Screen.
  * **VPN Server to VPN Client** and **VPN Server to IPSET List**
    * The IP address of the VPN Server in the openvpn-event up/down scripts is no longer hard coded. Instead, the 'nvram get' command in the openvpn-event up/down scripts will be used to obtain the IP address of the VPN Server. This will eliminate the need to rerun the **x3mRouting.sh** script if the VPN Server IP address is changed.
    * Routing rules will now be applied during an VPN Client up event rather than a VPN Server up event. Based on user feedback, the routing from the VPN Server to the VPN Client would stop working after a VPN Client up/down event, even though the iptables rules were still in effect.
    * Added ability to specify
      * more than one ASN when using the ASN method
      * more than one AWS region when using the Amazon AWS method
      * one or more IPv4 address when creating an IPSET list.
      * one or more search criteria for domain names when using the 'autoscan' option.
      * that a routing rule to be applied to a single LAN IP addresses or IP address range.
    * Added ability to display usage notes by passing the 'help' parameter
````
      sh x3mRouting.sh help
````

#### LAN Client Routing Changes
  * The script **x3mRouting_client_config.sh** now stores the output file **x3mRouting_client_config** in **/jffs/scripts/x3mRouting** rather than **/jffs/configs**.
  * The script **x3mRouting_client_nvram.sh** now stores the nvram files in **/jffs/addons/x3mRouting** rather than **/jffs/configs**.

## Version 2.0.0 Update Process

  1.  Type **x3mRouting** at the command line to access the Installation Menu.
  2.  Select the **[10]  Update x3mRouting Menu** option.
  3.  After the update has completed, select the **[u]  Update to new version of x3mRouting** option.

During the update process, the x3mRouting Installation Menu will:
  * Backup **/jffs/scripts/nat-start** and copy the x3mRouting directory contents to **/jffs/scripts/x3mRouting/backup**.
  * Remove obsolete x3mRouting scripts.
  * Any LAN Client Routing nvram files that exist will get moved to **/jffs/addons/x3mRouting** and the **x3mRouting_client_rules** file from **/jffs/configs** to **/jffs/scripts/x3mRouting** directory.
  * **/jffs/scripts/nat-start** and openvpn-event files in the **/jffs/scripts/x3mRouting** directory will be scanned for references to the old scripts or routing rules. A conversion file will get created in **/jffs/scripts/x3mRouting/x3mRouting_Conversion.sh** containing the new script entries using the new usage syntax.
  * Remove prior x3mRouting version entries found in **/jffs/scripts/nat-start** or **vpnclientX-route-up** files. If only a **#!/bin/sh** or comment lines exist, the user will be prompted to remove the file. The recommendation is to select the option to remove the file. A backup of **nat-start** and the local x3mRouing repository exists in case you need to recover.
  * Update the remaining x3mRouting scripts to the new version.

4.  View the **/jffs/scripts/x3mRouting/x3mRouting_Conversion.sh** script and validate. A line showing the prior entry and file source will be shown with the new entry. Only entries involving routing to the WAN interface may require an edit. The new version requires that the VPN Client to bypass be specified. The conversion utility will assume the VPN Client you want to bypass is '1'. If necessary, edit the '1' to be the VPN Client number '1-5' you want to bypass. When done, save the conversion script and execute it (e.g. **sh x3mRouting_Conversion.sh**). After execution, the IPSET list and associated routing rules, if specified, will be created along with the required entries in **/jffs/scripts/nat-start** and appropriate openvpn-event up/down files. An example of the conversion file is shown below:
````
#!/bin/sh
# Source File====> /jffs/scripts/nat-start
# Original Entry=> sh /jffs/scripts/x3mRouting/load_DNSMASQ_ipset_iface.sh 5 MOVETV movetv.com

````
5. Run the commands below to validate VPN Server POSTROUTING and VPN Client PREROUTING rules. POSTROUTING rules only get created for **VPN Server to VPN Client** and **VPN Server to IPSET List** rules.
